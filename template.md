We envision the OS Playbook landing somewhere between a traditional set of tech docs and a set of explanatory blog posts (or Source articles) breaking down what you, its authors, have learned about open sourcing projects in newsrooms. To help you get started, we've sketched some "playbok modules" that we've noticed working well in other documentation so that if you're not certain how to begin (or continue), you can refer back to this list for some fruitful options.

# PLAYBOOK MODULES

# Section Orientation/Context
**States explicitly what this section or subsection of the playbook is about and what it will do, and for whom.** A lot of well organized docs include this, but few do it as consistently and explicitly as the [Django docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/intro/overview/).

# Topic-Level Section
[Topic] is [definition]. It's important because [why].

## Point or principle
1-2 grafs explaining the principle, generallyâ€”longer prose will be friendlier if broken into subsections or interspersed with examples (or both).

### Example or Narrative
Scenario, anecdote, code snippet, diagram, whatever is useful. This is a fine place for the kind of example you see in technical documentation, but it's also a good place for you to relate how you handled a relevant part of an open source project yourself, and what you learned along the way. 

### Optional deeper detail
Also likely illustrated with an example.

### Optional inline definition (may be in a literal callout box)
These are especially helpful when using semi-arcane terms, but also when you want to distinguish between two seemingly similar ideas.

### Summary or closing tips, if needed

## Next point or principle
1-2 grafs, etc.
