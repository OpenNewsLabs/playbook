MODULES

# Orientation/Context
States explicitly what this section or subsection of the playbook is about and what it will do, and for whom.

[Optional branching: if X, skip to section Y.]

# Topic-Level Section
[Topic] is [definition]. It's important because [why].

## Point or principle
1-2 grafs explaining the principle, generallyâ€”longer prose will be friendlier if broken into subsections or interspersed with examples (or both).

### Example
Scenario, anecdote, code snippet, diagram, whatever is useful.

### Optional deeper detail
Also likely illustrated with an example.

### Optional inline definition (may be in a literal callout box)
These are especially helpful when using semi-arcane terms, but also when you want to distinguish between two seemingly similar ideas.

### Summary or closing tips, if needed

## Next point or principle
1-2 grafs, etc.
