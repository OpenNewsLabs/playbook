> ### How the documentation is organized
> 
> Django has a lot of documentation. A high-level overview of how it’s organized will help you know where to look for certain things:
> 
> * Tutorials take you by the hand through a series of steps to create a Web application. Start here if you’re new to Django or Web application development. Also look at the “First steps” below.
> * Topic guides discuss key topics and concepts at a fairly high level and provide useful background information and explanation.
> * Reference guides contain technical reference for APIs and other aspects of Django’s machinery. They describe how it works and how to use it but assume that you have a basic understanding of key concepts.
> * How-to guides are recipes. They guide you through the steps involved in addressing key problems and use-cases. They are more advanced than tutorials and assume some knowledge of how Django works.

> ### First steps
