## Rough Cut from Erin's Twitter survey

###Django (4)
http://djangoproject.com  Complete, literate, filled with practical examples, includes full tutorial.

Django! <3 the examples, no "doc rot", log of changes in new versions, links to view source. like a warm fuzzy blanket of docs.

The tutorials are real-world/narrative based. They walk you through “How to Do X”, but  also take the time (if you’re interested) in explaining **why** you’re doing X. They serve both shallow/deep users. 

### csvkit
I frequently recommend @onyxfish’s csvkit docs as a solid way to learn the *nix command line.

### Lodash (3)
Lodash is pretty impressive. Lots of examples (with live demos), links to source code, searchable.
lodash.com
 lodash docs, because I can try it from console
 
 It's concise, informationally-dense, and easy to reference over and over again.

### The Rust Programming Language
I don't know if this counts because it's not strictly API docs, but The Rust Programming Language: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ . I'd never done systems programming and this book (which is open source and part of the core documentaion) made me feel like I could

### Boost
Not quite what you're asking…I've always loved how Boost's docs include the rationale for decisions:
Writing Documentation for Boost - Documentation Structure - 1.59.0
boost.org

### Simple Statistics
http://simplestatistics.org/  by @tmcw et al is very good. Actual literate programming, and a library.

@rustlang’s docs are amazing, and their improvement is used as a way to introduce newcomers to the language.

### Perl (3)
The documentation in Perl is generally quite good. (The IA of the package system is as well.) Mozilla DN docs are also ace. (Underscoring IA of <xyz programming language> module repositories as a huge huge HUGE issue.)

all the Perl modules until about 2002. A good culture of providing basic usage -> concrete examples -> reference -> advanced notes.

### PHP.net (4)
 people live http://php.net . It's hideous, but apparently very useful.
PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor
php.net

 http://php.net  for its breadth and for its very helpful community input in the comments; jQuery for same reasons

### Wordpress (2)
https://developer.wordpress.org/reference  among others. Pretty much anything with clear (visual rocks) real use examples.
Reference | WordPress Developer Resources
developer.wordpress.org

i'm partial to http://codex.wordpress.org  (and http://make.wordpress.org ). clear, friendly, extensive, w/examples.

### jQuery (2)
 http://php.net  for its breadth and for its very helpful community input in the comments; jQuery for same reasons

### MDN (2)
those two plus MDN

### Source Sans type design story
Best Open Source documentation of a project? The Source Sans type design story from @AdobeType, definitely.

 
### ZeroMQ
And, differently good, ZeroMQ's doc design kinda matches its philosophy; + it has voice, attitude

### dplyr & ggplot
anything by @hadleywickham, but in particular dplyr & ggplot

### Angular 2
 The angular 2 docs are impressive. Lightweight for newbies, progressing to detailed deep dives.

### Python Requests Library
I've always liked the docs for pythons requests library great.

### Open Stack
Probably #OpenStack ... well curated and pretty complete
OpenStack Docs: Current
docs.openstack.org

### OpenBSD
OpenBSD man pages and documentation are really, really good

### Music Store tutorial for @SuaveIO
Music Store tutorial for @SuaveIO  makes no assumptions re starting knowledge, builds smthing practical from scratch

### Elm

compiler-errors-for-humans
elm-lang.org

### Flask
Flask's documentation is excellent:
Welcome | Flask (A Python Microframework)
flask.pocoo.org

### jQuery API
 I would have to say http://api.jquery.com  it's all well described in  "human-readable" format and there are examples and a demos.
jQuery API Documentation
jQuery: The Write Less, Do More, JavaScript Library
api.jquery.com


### mdn and web platform dot org

### Numpy
Most that I’d mention are already mentioned, but I like numpy for combining brevity with useful examples:
numpy.clip — NumPy v1.11 Manual
docs.scipy.org

### Django Girls intro to Python
Introduction · Django Girls Tutorial
tutorial.djangogirls.org

http://FreeBSD.org/handbook  covers a huge amount of things you might want to do when you setup a system

### grailsfw
the #grailsfw docs are the best oss docs I've ever seen. They just answer every question...


### www.slf4j.org
http://www.slf4j.org/manual.html  takes some beating (because it tells you exactly what you need to know and is really well written).

### @BecomingDataSci 

### @habitica 

### @fedora 
have excellent "how to contribute" documentation. Comprehensive while still welcoming.

### if you're nerding out on docs, @readthedocs and @writethedocs have great resources! /@ericholscher

personally, my fave examples are friendly, explain why you should use (not just how), and have clear examples/tutorials :)

### RYAN'S SURVEY—EXAMPLES OF GOOD DOCS

A sampling of responses to recent Twitter plea:
* Django Project (mentioned by _several_ people, and would have been high on my personal list as well)
* Underscore
* PHP.net (Waldo Jaquith suggested for interface + info)
* Redis
* PostgreSQL
* Twilio
* Tarbell
* Agate

one theme that came up here as well as in conversation with Chris Groskopf: example-driven documentation. People LOVE when docs have real-world examples instead of just explanations and API references.
